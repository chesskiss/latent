What have I done/tried so far:
1.  Perturbed teachers?
2.  Trained, evaluated (likelihood), and compared students and teachers over teachers...
3.  Visualized initial true params emissions
    Evaluate all on unseen teacher T3 V
    Repeating each curriculum with many randomly initialized students. V
    Visualize results: Use rings on teacher's data, and graph the dataframe's data V
    Generalize student S_l V
    Keep function extractions and organizations for teachers, etc. V
    Fix 2D plotting V
4. Added decoding
5. Tried lower learning rate, and reducing/increasing epochs to analyse behavior
